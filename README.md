School Project
============
Keeping this one here untill better place have been found.


I was working as an developer/programmer in a game project called [Toy Trail](http://www.toytrailgame.com/). It is a chess-like strategy game for children.

Rights were sold to Mediaholvi osk. I do not have rights to the product or code anymore. Here some old pictures and [video](https://youtu.be/2ItnT4k01Cs).
